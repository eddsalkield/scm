# About

This is a project for PRT455 (Software Engineering Practice).
The idea is to build a dotfiles manager that is fast, stable, and features the
best from a selection of other dotfiles managers and community interest.

Direction for the project taken from initial research, documented in the
[project plan](docs/PRT455-project-plan-SamuelWalladge.pdf), and a
[survey](https://swalladge.id.au/posts/2017/08/07/dotfiles-config-survey.html).

A sub goal of this is to learn rust, so the code may be a bit iffy...

GitHub issues are currently used for tracking progress and documenting
lower level requirements.


# Testing

For continuous integration, all tests are run on every push with Travis.

Unit tests are run by cargo with `cargo test`. These are tests on individual
functions and small functionality within each module, created as standard in
rust. ([Rust book reference on testing](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/second-edition/ch11-01-writing-tests.html))

Integration tests are for testing the program as a whole. They are important
for this software, since its core functionality is working with files and
links; many side effects. These are implemented with custom bash scripts. Run
as follows:

```
$ ./integration_tests.sh

$ # or for a single test:
$ ./integration_tests.sh test_no_force_install.sh

$ # or to disable kcov (useful for local testing - faster)
$ ./integration_tests.sh --no-kcov
$ ./integration_tests.sh --no-kcov test_no_force_install.sh
```

Each test must a bash script in the `./test/integration_tests/`. The main bash
script runner runs each test by sourcing the bash script and calling the
`run_test` function. All code should be inside the `run_test` function and
locally scoped to avoid clashing with the main script or other tests.
The tests get some variables to use:

- `exe`           | the binary to run for the dotfiles manager (with kcov)
- `exe_sans`      | the binary to run for the dotfiles manager (sans kcov)
- `$TEMP_LOCAL`   | the local directory to do stuff in - make files, etc - reset after each test
- `$BASE_DIR`     | root directory of project

Basically, for anything new, there should be unit tests that cover any
functions that don't have IO side effects, and integration tests for any
functionality that interacts with std{in,out,err} or files/link/directories.


# Code coverage

Code coverage reports are generated with `kcov` and uploaded to the [Coveralls
project](https://coveralls.io/github/swalladge/dotfiles-manager).

They can be generated and viewed locally with `make coverage`.
